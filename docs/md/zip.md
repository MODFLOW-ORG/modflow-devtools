# `MFZipFile`

Python's [`ZipFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) doesn't [preserve file permissions at extraction time](https://bugs.python.org/issue15795). The `MFZipFile` subclass modifies `ZipFile.extract()` to do so, as per the recommendation [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39296101/python-zipfile-removes-execute-permissions-from-binaries), and maintains identical behavior otherwise.
