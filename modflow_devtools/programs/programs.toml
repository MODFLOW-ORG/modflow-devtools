# This file tells modflow-devtools where to find program registries.
# Programs are discovered from GitHub release assets (programs.toml)
# published alongside platform-specific distributions.
#
# Each source provides one or more programs (e.g., modflow6 provides
# mf6, zbud6, libmf6) as specified in the source's registry file.
