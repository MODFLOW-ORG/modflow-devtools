# Programs API Bootstrap Configuration
#
# This file tells modflow-devtools where to find program registries.
# Programs are discovered from GitHub release assets.
#
# Each source provides one or more programs (e.g., modflow6 provides mf6, zbud6, libmf6).
# Program names are globally unique across all sources.
